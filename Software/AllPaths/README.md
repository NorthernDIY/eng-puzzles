# AllPaths:
Algorithm used for generating a library of paths from a given input maze.  (For use with future machine learning work)

## MazeSolverMain9.py:
inputs a black and white photo of a maze orientated bottom(start) to top(finish) in 70:50 pixel size and uses a random weighted backtracking algorithm to output random succesful paths as list of list of coordinates.  

## csv2Panda.py:
inputs csv files of accelerometer data and positioning data and outputs organized Panda dataframes

### Requires:
- Python V3.7
